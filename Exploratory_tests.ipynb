Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\\n\\nJoon: Right. So I was born in Korea. I lived there for the first 12 years or so of my life. And my parents and I moved to Boston. So my parents were pursuing their postdoctoral degree. They're both medical doctors. So we moved to Boston. So we lived there for five years. And then I went to high school in New Hampshire after that, college in Pennsylvania, called Swarthmore College. It's a liberal arts college. And towards the end of my college years, one other co-founder and I started to run a startup. So while we were running that, as we were graduating, we moved to Palo Alto. So we lived by somebody's garage, actually, for about a year. The typical thing that you do if you're into that. The startup itself didn't pan out. But during that year, I got to know this group of researchers and community in the computer science department at Stanford, just by through some luck and just, yeah, through pure luck. And I started to work on some research projects with them. So I spent about a half a year, a little bit more than maybe half a year working with them. And then I went to get my master's in computer science at UIUC, that's Illinois Urbana-Champaign. So I spent two years of my life there. And when I was finishing that up, I moved back to Palo Alto, started my PhD as a computer science PhD student at Stanford. And I've been here since then. So this is my year five of doing that.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that overview! I'd love to learn more about your experiences. Can you tell me what it was like for you adjusting to life in Boston after moving from Korea? What were some of the challenges you faced during that transition?\\n\\nJoon: It's a good question. Well, moving to a different country and different culture for any child and their parents, it's a heavy lift. But I think likely what was sort of the most interesting was the fact that the entire family, to some extent, was sort of at this point where they were all trying to figure out their career and so forth. My dad actually was already a professor by then and it was sort of his sabbatical years he was spending, so he likely was the most settled amongst us. But certainly for my mom, she was pursuing a postdoctoral degree, so she was transitioning more towards the medical research, the academic research side of things, at least in her discipline. So I think she was really trying to do this sort of a superhuman thing of trying to figure out her new career path, what research areas she wanted to be involved in, while trying to raise a teenager in a new country. So I think that was sort of an interesting period for her and for my parents. And that moment of transition does trickle down to obviously the child as well. So I grew up sort of seeing them trying to figure those kind of things out with a lot of uncertainty. They weren't, I don't think, even sure whether they wanted to stay in the US in sort of the American academic system or sort of head back to Korea, where they sort of could just get a professorship there. So I think they were all trying to figure that out. Maybe as a side effect of that, maybe because of the uncertainty, for some reason, I took this habit of walking around the town quite a bit, often alone. I lived in this small town called Newton. It's a small town in the suburban area of Boston. It's a beautiful place. And I would just walk around and try to sort of get away from things. So that was a transition. \\n\\n\\nInterviewer: That sounds like a challenging but formative period in your life. You mentioned that you used to walk around a lot to deal with the uncertainties. How did those walks and that time of reflection shape you as a person? Did it have any lasting impact on how you approach new situations or challenges?\\n\\nJoon: It did. It's a habit that I formed fairly early on and, you know, it's a habit that sort of lasted throughout sort of my teenage years, all the way through high school and parts of college. Obviously, you know, once you're in college, you know, life sort of, you know, takes you in other directions. So you sometimes cannot hang on to your old habits. But certainly when I was a teenager, I'm walking around different places, I think was sort of a big part. It's a good question. I, you know, you think about, you know, some random things, right? I mean, you know, like, what are sort of the main axioms that you want to sort of hold on to in your life? I think sort of the thoughts that I had, I, the way sort of I internalize myself at this point, so I'm now 30, is that I haven't really changed much as a person since I was, let's say, maybe 16 or so. And I think most of the decisions about who I am and who I was going to be, I think I sort of made during those years. I do care a lot about seasons. They just, you know, in season and like nature, right? So Boston and New Hampshire, these areas, you know, there's a lot of snow. So the winter is snowy and brutal, but beautiful in sort of a, you know, very sort of stern way. Spring is bright and you can sort of smell the end of the winter and you can smell the flowers. Summer can be very hot and humid. I sort of grew up being used to humid summers because Korea and I spent some part of my life in Japan as well. And those places have very humid summer. And it was the same for Boston and New Hampshire. Fall, you know, the Boston and New Hampshire falls are beautiful, like one of the most beautiful autumn autumnal sort of places that you can ever find. So, you know, I grew up watching the seasons change and I think it's sort of the nice thing about, you know, I think in part because my parents were also busy, so they didn't really care about what I was doing during the day. Right. Many Asian parents care a lot about what their kids do during the day. My parents didn't really care. So they sort of let me do whatever I wanted to do. That was the case for high school as well. I went to  a boarding school and, you know, in boarding school, sometimes there's, you know, you can be a little bit more free? So I would just walk around the pond or the forest and stuff like that. So there was sort of less supervision in terms of what I could do or what I ought to do. And, you know, I spent most of my time basically sort of in the nature, changing, you know, seeing how the seasons change and all these kind of things. And I don't know what concretely like that, you know, had an impact on other than the fact that I think it had, you know, to me, it feels like that was a very core part of who I was? Something about seeing the nature and seasons change, come and go, and everything repeats, sort of puts you in perspective about like, you know, that, you know, there's the circulatory fractal structure to the life that we live. \\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing all that. It sounds like those walks and the changing seasons had a profound impact on you. Could you tell me more about your time in high school and college—what were some of the formative experiences or relationships that influenced your path towards a career in computer science and research?\\n\\nJoon: So I was not a computer scientist for most of my childhood and through most of my college years, maybe halfway through college years, I transitioned, but I actually, I was into art and sort of, well, art and music at first. I mean, I was really into music when I was growing up, classical music. I played the violin, sort of the way I describe it as, you know, I wasn't particularly talented in music, but I was really passionate about it. And I spent a lot of hours. So like from middle school to high school, I would practice, you know, three, four hours a day. You know, I sort of saw it as a core part of, you know, who I am, like how I was viewed. Many people sort of, many, you know, friends during those era, not that I had that many friends, but, you know, many friends during that time sort of saw me as, oh, you're the guy who plays the violin, you're the guy who's in the orchestra. So that was sort of a fundamental part of who I was. I wasn't talented again. So, you know, I think there's, I don't think I really had a career in that profession, but I was drawn to those kinds of things. On the side, I would draw a lot. I think, you know, one of the things that I really loved doing was, you know, taking walks and then sort of drawing what I saw, you know, out in nature. I also really like, I don't like, I never really, you know, was sort of the social person or like very like outgoing person. I was very introverted throughout my childhood. And even now I'm very introverted. Although my career does ask me to be a little bit more outgoing nowadays by definition. I was very introverted by nature. So I never really liked talking to people, but I really like observing them. And I made a lot of drawings and paintings of people. And that was always really fun and, you know, a fundamental part of what I really enjoyed during that time. So I did a lot of that. So again, go out, draw, you know, and take photos. I took a lot of photos. And then during that time, one of sort of the high school teacher who was a supervisor in the dorm that I lived, saw one of my drawings and he was the art teacher at our school. And I never took art classes. I didn't know that this was a thing I could do. And he just thought I was drawing for hobby. And then he saw my drawings and he was like, hmm, okay, you're. Well, it sort of started. So, you know, these dorm advisors, they would come once a week. They take rotation every night. And during the nights when he's on rotation, he would come and we would chat and he would bring like these art books and lend them to me. And he was like, hey, you know what you've done here with this art or with this drawing is really interesting in this ways, you know, take a look at this or that, right. So he would do a lot of that, which was really in many ways fortunate for me, obviously. So we spent a lot of time doing that. And then after about half a year to a year, he told me, OK, you're you should join my art class. And I did. And I sort of started sort of a semi-career in art. I mean, you know, I wasn't professional back then, but I was very interested. And I think everyone sort of quickly got the sense that this guy was actually good. You know, he was sort of there is something unusual about the way I sort of went about doing art. So I think they sort of tried to at least get me exposed to more of that environment. And when I went to college, I initially started because of that, perhaps as an art and sociology major. And that continued for most of my time during college. So I was an art major. So I, again, was the guy who spent a lot of time in the studio. So most of times I'd be sort of in this, you know, in this very ragged clothes with a bunch of paint, you know, stains on it and so forth. So I was, you know, a little bit of that character. And so I spent quite a number of hours doing that. And I gradually became fairly, you know, it became clear that, you know, this could actually be a professional career. And interesting thing about my parents was sort of that they were actually OK with that. They actually thought you could actually make or they at least they thought that I could at least make money doing this for whatever reason. And I wouldn't disagree with it. And, you know, I thought we had a shot. So I started to pursue that. But somewhere along the way, I got deeply interested in sort of this more of a technical project. Again, this is where computer science comes in. A technical project where, you know, I had an idea for a startup was sort of all related to self-expression and so forth. So I think there's some obvious thread that we were trying to tie together. And that required technical expertise. So I started to take some computer science courses. So there was a bit of a, you know, undergrad, you know, you're trying to figure out what you want to do. And as I was trying to figure out, oh, am I going to do art? Or is there something else? And I wanted to at least try this out. And I went and Swarthmore was sort of a, you know, this college where they would let you explore different things fairly late on. So they would actually let me take intro to computer science courses and let me double major. So I had to drop sociology, but I got to major in computer science and art at the same time for that time. So I kept on doing that. And when I was graduating, we thought we sort of had a product together. So we decided to just go for it. So it turns out, you know, the work that I ended up doing, so I mean, again, I'm a researcher now, but the work I ended up doing actually is very much like art, right? In the sense that, you know, you write papers, but writing papers is very much like making art pieces and publishing it, right? You get to work on an idea for a long time. It means a lot to you. And it's an expression of, you know, what you experience and so forth. And you get to sort of stamp your name on it and send it out. And that was always sort of a fascinating part of that experience. So that's, I'd say, how that sort of all led to where this is.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\\n\\nJoon: It's an interesting question. I enjoyed my time as a researcher and my professional career, I think. I've been very happy with this journey. But what's interesting about the journey that I've taken, or at least the way I perceive my life, was for whatever reason, I never really had that many options. In each sort of moments of my life, in retrospect, I always felt like I got one choice. There wasn't much decision that had to be made where the choice was very obvious. Even all the way back to things like, for instance, where to go to high school and college. I wasn't particularly a good student in any sense of that word for most of my childhood. Maybe I was for some part of it, at least some part that actually mattered. But at the end of the day, I got accepted to one school that actually I would be interested in going. It wasn't sort of this, oh, I have many great options, maybe I can pick and choose. It wasn't quite that. I was like, no, you have one good option, you're going to take that. When I started my professional career, for a while, that actually was the case, too. And then when I was deciding where to be for my PhD career as well, that time, actually, I actually did have options. But my interest has sort of gotten focused enough that I didn't really seriously at some point start to consider other paths, other than, this is what I want to do, and the best place to do it actually here is going to be Stanford, and the people here. So that's how I felt about my journey. I don't know why this ended up being that way. But I always felt like I never really got that many options. And I think it was for the better. And I sort of have accepted that to be a factor of my life where, you know, things are going to happen. Every living moment, I try to do the best work that I can do. And whatever sort of comes next, there will be a path that will open up. And again, I don't expect there to be many paths that I need to, like many great paths that I need to mull over. Like one path will open up for the next stage. And I just need to walk through the door. But just make sure that I walk through it. Sometimes it was a little bit daunting. And I think my, I think there were moments where I sort of had a lot of hesitation, where, you know, the option was clear, but I was sort of afraid to walk through the door for various reasons, right. But sometimes, you know, that can be very daunting. I think I over the years had great set up in my, you know, my parents, especially my mom was sort of my early guide into many of these. But after that, I also had a lot of great mentors who sort of pushed me to make the right choices in these moments. So in that way, I think I was lucky to sort of have had that experience. But yeah, at the end of the day, that's how I see it.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that perspective. It sounds like you've had a clear sense of direction in your life. You mentioned moments of hesitation and fear when a clear option was ahead. Could you tell me about one such specific moment in more detail? What were the stakes, what caused the hesitation, and how did you eventually decide to move forward?\\n\\nJoon: So you know, when likely the most recent one, you know, was again, I told you that I'm a PhD student, this is my fifth year. And what was interesting was, you know, I wanted to do this research at the intersection of what we call human-computer interaction, AI, and so forth. I always had this view, and this was a little bit coming from my days as a, you know, when I was running startup. But I got the sense that in technology has ebbs and flows, right, where there are periods when technology is sort of in its infancy, but you think something is happening. But technology itself that has been developed during that time isn't ready for the primetime like industry market. During those times, sometimes there's a lot of boom in industry. So when I came into the scene, or when I sort of grew up, this is sort of 2005 to 2015, there was sort of a lot of excitement around, you know, the network, the internet, right, the social network, early sort of versions of social network was just being born. And then pretty soon, there were sort of these gig works that were born as an artifact of these networks. So there was a lot of those applications that were being really successful. But you know, when I was trying to go into the industry was around 2017, and that market was sort of in its, you know, it was very successful, the market was big, but all the known players or what will be the known players were already sort of set in place. So there weren't that many opportunities to crack into that space. But another sort of absent flow that was happening was the research that was sort of in its dormant, like in early stages, when all that movement in industry was going on, especially on AI was actually about to start working, and there was 17 and 18. Like AI didn't really work right before 2014, before ImageNet, and so forth, and before the neural net and all this development. I started to sense, especially, I don't know, the magical part of being in the bear, yeah, was, you know, I sort of got the visceral sense in my body that something was about to change. And, you know, this was the magical part, interestingly, was actually, this wasn't really by talking to anyone, even, or, you know, reading research papers, I was not a researcher back then. So I didn't know anything about this. But just by living in the area, and sort of seeing, you know, people move around, they start to get this sense that, oh, something is about to work. But it wasn't quite there yet, right, it was 2017. So it was before GPT, like all this, like generative AI excitement. So I decided, this might actually be a good time to do research. So I decided, well, so I go do that. So I got very excited by this human-computer interaction and AI area. Because I thought, given my skillset, trying to understand, like, condition the fact that AI might soon work and end its sort of research phase, when would it be the time? What would be the application that AI can really support that's going to be transformative? And given my experience, especially, you know, with the startup and, you know, with my other backgrounds, I realized that that intersection seemed fantastically interesting. For that work, the right place to do that work was, to me, Stanford, right? It was near the industry. And so there was a lot of proximity to many of these exciting research, but also the influence from industry. And at the same time, there were a group of scholars in this space, who ended up becoming my advisors and mentors, who were doing the work that, to me, was sort of the most exciting and inspiring during that era, that, you know, wasn't necessarily AI even sometimes. One of my advisors, Michael Bernstein, you know, he was working on cross-sourcing, Percy Liang. I don't think I yet have been, when I was sort of an undergrad and master's, I haven't yet been sort of introduced to his work yet. But the sense I got was some of the work that they were doing in these different spaces, you know, if something felt right, that a lot of the things that we learned during that era and in these other fields would transfer over as we start thinking about how to apply AI to different applications. So that really got me excited. So, you know, after my master's, the right place to do my PhD, to me, was always internally fairly obvious that I was going to be at Stanford. The scary part is that, well, that means I need to go to Stanford and be amongst all of these amazing colleagues. And what's fun about this is, you know, I got in, right, and I think advisors seem to have had some confidence that I might be a good student. But, you know, that's totally different than now you actually have to join and actually stand next to all these amazing researchers who you've looked up to for many years and that you know they've done great work and you sort of question yourself, like, can I actually do the work? Can I perform at the level where, you know, I would actually make impact, that I wouldn't embarrass myself, that I wouldn't disappoint these sets of really great colleagues. And that scares you. I mean, it certainly scared me. It doesn't stop me, which I think was good. At the same time, I think there were people who ended up giving sort of really good advice. The person who sort of I'm still grateful for, like, there's, I have a mentor named Merrie Morris, and she, Merrie was the first person who told me to just go to Stanford. I don't know why, I don't think she like fully explained her rationale. But she told me, because in part, I was sort of thinking of maybe I can stay at University of Illinois, because you know, I know this environment, it's a great research program. And Merrie told me, well, you've already learned. So it's a good thing to move institutions between programs, right between your master's and then PhD. So go to Stanford. And I listened to Merrie. She was like, actually the only person who said that like straight to my face, like, you know, go to Stanford, or not go to Stanford directly, but like, you know, very strongly implied that it might be a good idea. And I followed her advice. And, you know, and that ended up being a really good decision, in the sense that I got to do the work that I, you know, the type of work that I really wanted to do. And it's been a very exciting journey.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people tell us they made a conscious choice or decision in moments like these, while others say it 'just happened'. What about you?\\n\\nJoon: I thought deeply about this, so all the decisions I made, I don't make them at random. I think deeply about it, and when I decide something is a good idea, then it's a very conscious choice. But at the same time, I think the options that were presented to me were presented in a way where any clear thinker would find one right solution, that there wasn't this many options that I can compare against and ponder about. So that's how I saw it. So I think the options that were presented to me sort of happened on their own, but I did reflect on why the option that was presented had the right answer, and that was internalized very explicitly and consciously.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Do you think another person or an organization could have lent a helping hand during moments like this?\\n\\nJoon: I'm not sure about organization, but maybe. But my career has really been shaped by many mentors. Early on and even today, my mom did play the role of a professional mentor, in part because she was a researcher. She's a PhD, she's a researcher in a completely different field. She doesn't know what I do, but she sort of understand the cultural context. And she was in fact the first person who recommended to me that I try this out. I think for whatever reason, she thought I might be good at it. She told me, you know, I know you, I know you well enough. I think you'd be good at research. So pursue it and gave me some pointers as to how I might start doing that. I don't think I, you know, I think if I had sort of one superpower, it was having sort of the set of mentors and guides in my life who gave me these advice. And I was very good at discerning what were sort of the advice that I ought to listen to and I follow through with them, right? So I think that was my superpower, which is like I had good set of people giving me mentorship. I appreciated who the good mentors were and what were the good advice. And when I made the promise that, yes, I'll deliver on this or yes, I follow through on this, I did. And that continued to be the case, right? So I mentioned this mentor, Merrie, who over the years had sort of profound impact on sort of how, in my view, my career really shaped up. During my master's, I had this mentor, Carrie Carajalios. She was my master's advisor, another person sort of who had a profound impact in the way sort of I went about building my career. And then Michael Bernstein and Percy Leung, like these advisors, I think sort of continue to play that role and many others. But yeah, so I think these people can always help. Another way of saying it is without them, it's, I don't think you really have a career, you so it's, you need them.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Moving to present time, tell me more about family who are important to you. Do you have a partner, or children?\\n\\nJoon: So I have my parents. It's a small family so I'm the only child. They do, you know, they're a close family. Like I call them every week, you know. And again, they have been a great support. I don't think I, I was a child who, who needed some help in the sense that I am. I, you know, my, I think many of the ideas that I had I think were directionally all right. Right. So the ideas that I got while walking around the woods, certainly I think like that's still who I am. The thoughts I had in my like late middle school and high school era, like that is who I am even today. So I think they're true or at least have served me well. But the way you sort of marry that with reality, sometimes, you know, you need a little bit more finesse. My, my idea of a good life was to be self-sufficient. And then like I still have this book, Walden by Henry Thoreau. You know, like when I was growing up in Boston, I usually, every weekend I had my mom drive up to, drive me up to Walden Pond. You know, that's where, of course, Henry Thoreau wrote the book. And we would walk around. It's, you know, by, so we conquered where the Walden Pond is located. Really wasn't that far from where we lived. It's a beautiful town. I still love it. And, you know, one of the places where I would love to visit if I had the time. And, you know, my, my idea of a good life actually was be like that. Right. You know, sort of be self-sufficient to some extent, or maybe run a small shop, but, you know, in a small town, I actually still think that's actually a good life. And honestly, like, I think there's actually a fairly good chance that I might just do that at some point in my career. And, you know, when I feel like I might work here, it's mostly done. And I think I'd be very happy doing that even now. But, you know, there are certain things that you cannot explore unless you sort of, you know, venture out and actually do the rigorous work of making things happen as well. And I didn't really have any sense of that. I was, in some kids, I think, actually do have a sense of that, right? They know that, oh, you know, you do your sort of place in this context of society and so forth. So, you know, sometimes that actually comes more naturally to some people, it did not come naturally to me. So I need a lot of help there. So yeah. So that's what I would say. So there. So my again, my parents are important to me. And, yeah, in terms of partner and children, I do not have any kids, or I'm not married.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Are there anyone else in your immediate family whom you have not mentioned? Who are they, and what is your relationship with them like?\\n\\nJoon: I mean, I have relatives, but I think, again, it's a fairly small but tight family.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me about anyone else in your life we haven’t discussed. Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\\n\\nJoon: I have very close friends who I've known for a long time, more than half of my life. My life generally has been one where I'm not very social or outgoing per se, but I usually retain very close but small circle of friends who know me very well, and they tend to stay for a long time. So there are some of those friends. We do spend time together, quite a bit of time, even nowadays. I do think it's actually a lot of work to maintain relationships of any kind, so I often also see this as sort of a big investment. So there are a few people like that, yeah.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Now let’s talk about your current neighborhood. Tell me all about the neighborhood and area in which you are living now.\\n\\nJoon: I live in Palo Alto. When I started my PhD program here at Stanford, I decided that I lived on campus for too long in my life. I lived on campus in a dorm for high school, college. I basically lived on campus for my master's. I was like, I'm really done doing this. So I decided to live off campus, but I don't drive. So I can't live too far outside the area. So I got an apartment near campus. It's about a five minute drive from Stanford. So really not too far away. And yeah, it's a nice town. I mean, it's Palo Alto, so it's, you know, there is okay food. I mean, everything is very overpriced, but I think it's sort of a nice place to be.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people say they feel really safe in their neighborhoods, others not so much. How about for you?\\n\\nJoon: I definitely feel safe, it's a nice town. I don't, I can walk around fairly late at night, I actually do, and it feels fine. I don't go to sort of the main street sometimes, too late at night, but otherwise it's very safe.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Living any place has its ups and downs. Tell me about what it’s been like for you living here.\\n\\nJoon: The ups are fairly clear. Palo Alto is a beautiful town, very historic. It has served as sort of the epicenter of many of the technological revolution that has happened, at least in the professional community that I'm now a part of. So all that, fantastic. It is overpriced. So the living cost tends to be fairly high. The food tends to be fairly expensive for what they give you. So, you know.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me about the people who live with you right now, even people who are staying here temporarily.\\n\\nJoon: Well, I live alone.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Is anyone in your household a temporary member, or is everyone a permanent member of the household?\\n\\nJoon: Everyone's permanent. I live alone.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me about anyone else who stays here from time to time, if there is anyone like that.\\n\\nJoon: Nope, no one liked that.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Is there anyone who usually lives here but is away – traveling, at school, or in a hospital?\\n\\nJoon: Nope. \\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Right now, across a typical week, how do your days vary?\\n\\nJoon: It changes a lot. So PhD life I've sort of found is very dynamic in the sense that every week you might be doing something different. Sometimes when it's sort of a deadline season, you're mostly, hopefully, in the writing mode. Other times you're brainstorming, you're meeting with people to get ideas, you're running experiments, building systems. So towards the end of, towards the latter year now of my PhD career, I sort of see things merge, right? So one day I need to be building a system, the next day I need to go back to writing for a different project or a different duty that I might have. There's also interesting amount of outreach, whether it's interview with other people or the media, to meeting people, to talk about my own research, and then there's more professional connection that you sort of need to build up over the years. It's certainly enjoyable. It's fun. I've had a lot of fun doing it, but it's very dynamic. So there's no sort of typical week anymore, but I'm usually in the lab seven days a week, I think, for most sort of hours. So I'm usually in the lab. I'm a night owl, so I come in around 11 a.m. or 12. I leave around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. \\n\\n\\nInterviewer: At what kind of job or jobs do you work, and when do you work?\\n\\nJoon: So again, I'm a PhD student. That really means sort of you're a researcher with some, you know, every once in a while you might have teaching duties and other things as a student, but it really means you're a researcher. So I'm a PhD student at Stanford Computer Science Department. I work on research related to, actually agents is sort of the main area that I work on. So we do work around AI agents, generative agents, simulations. Working hours are long, or for me at least, it has become quite extended. So I'm, again, usually in the office every day, 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. I think is fairly typical on any given day. During the day I might come in and out for different meetings or other events, but yeah.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Do you have other routines or responsibilities that you did not already share?\\n\\nJoon: Again, so PhD students, it does assume a few different things. Again, research is the main part. This quarter, I am actually teaching a class. So I am now a teacher. And we're a professor, real role to some undergrad students. And that's very new and exciting. I've never done that before, but that's one duty that I've taken this quarter. Thank you.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me about any recent changes to your daily routine.\\n\\nJoon: No, I mean, no, in the sense that, like, it's been changing every day, almost, you know, at any, like, there's no, like, routine day as a PhD student, I feel like, but, well, I mean, this quarter, certainly, I actually, it did bring some changes. And I think one of the reasons why I feel like this quarter actually has been a little bit busier than usual, where I at least try to take one evening off, so I usually have sort of this big sort of high-stake meeting, like, it's advisor meeting for PhD students, it's a project meeting, mine's on Thursday, 2 p.m., and that's been the time. So for my PhD career, I, in the past, like, when I was younger, in, like, first and second year, I actually took the weekends, or maybe, like, Friday off, or something like that, I took a day or so off, but in the recent years, I tried at least to take Thursday evening off after the advisor meeting, I'm like, okay, at least for that day, I'm done now that I'm done with this really big-stake, like, meeting. I lost that, and that still was big, so I usually need to get back to some other kind of duty after that meeting, and that feels really new to me, and I sort of tried to figure out why that's the case. I think a big part of this, I'm teaching this quarter, as I mentioned, so I am developing this new course on AI agents and simulations. We never offered it, but we are offering it as a core CS and AI curriculum at Stanford, and it's sort of, you know, it's a decently-sized class, never been taught, the course material is sort of, I'm making as I go. It's been really fulfilling and gratifying, but at the same time, the workload is non-trivial, so adding that to my existing schedule certainly, I think, did a number on my calendar, so that's been sort of the recent change that happened.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people we’ve talked to tell us about experiences with law enforcement. How about for you?\\n\\nJoon: Nothing you can think of.\\n\\nInterviewer: I see. Have you ever had instances where you’ve observed law enforcement interactions or heard about them from people close to you, like family or friends?\\n\\nJoon: No, no one close to me.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Given your background in Human-Computer Interaction and AI, have you come across discussions or case studies about law enforcement using technology in your field? I'm curious about any academic perspectives or indirectly observed experiences you might have encountered through your studies or research.\\n\\nJoon: Yeah, there was sort of a sort of very well-known case of machine learning, like especially vision models being used to identify potential suspects and so forth. And many sort of have considered that to be a negative use case of that technology because of the known biases against certain populations or population or less represented in the data set. So, yeah, there's been very important and interesting work that's been going on. But I think there's just a lot more work that needs to be done to make sure that this technology can sort of be applied in a sort of a safe and ethical way to these fields. So I think there's a big discussion that's going on that have been going on for quite some number of years now, although I'm not sort of the most knowledgeable sort of the domain expert in that area.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What other experiences with law enforcement stand out in your mind?\\n\\nJoon: Nothing much.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people tell us about experiences of arrest – of loved ones, family members, friends, or themselves. How about for you?\\n\\nJoon: None, fortunately.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people say they vote in every election, some tell us they don’t vote at all. How about you?\\n\\nJoon: I would vote, but I'm a permanent resident in the U.S. so I do not have the ability to vote.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Since you currently can't vote in the U.S., do you still engage in other forms of civic participation or follow political processes closely? And in the past, have you participated in elections in other countries where you might have had the right to vote?\\n\\nJoon: I follow the news very closely, or at least I used to, and then I got very stressful over the years, so maybe not as closely, or I try to at least be aware of the important topics that goes on so I can remain engaged and sensible. But I don't look at New York Times cover every day to find what's going on in politics. Other than that, no, when I was in Korea, I was too young to vote, and of course since then I've been in the U.S., so I didn't really get to vote then. So I'm sort of realizing that I never voted. That's kind of sad. Hopefully that's going to change soon.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: How would you describe your political views?\\n\\nJoon: That's a good question. You know, the spectrum sort of changes in this nation, so maybe I can, you know, I think I'm sort of your sort of very classic sort of center left during the Obama era. That's how I sort of would describe myself. So in terms of politicians, sort of I, when Obama was running his first and second election, I think I sort of, you know, looking back, ideologically, I think I'm sort of the most aligned with that view. So I think that's how I would describe my political views. Center left during the 2008 and 2012 era.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me about any recent changes in your political views.\\n\\nJoon: It doesn't really change too much. Yeah, my views don't really change over the years. It's sort of what I found. Again, I'm the same person I was when I was a high school kid. So, no. The world changes, obviously. What is right is right.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Now we’d like to learn more about your health. First, tell me all about your health.\\n\\nJoon: I'm healthy. Um, yeah, I'm, no, nothing particular that I need to mention about my health.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling healthy! To get a clearer picture, could you share a bit more detail? For example, do you have any specific routines or habits that you follow to maintain your health, such as exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, or managing stress effectively?\\n\\nJoon: I try to get exercise throughout sort of my PhD career, but it always falls off. I try my best for a while and it's too hard to maintain. So no, I mean, I try to eat regularly at least, but obviously sometimes I realize that when I eat too much, I get sleepy and that affects my work. So I'm a little bit concerned actually sometimes about my health. I'm healthy now, but I feel like if I maintain my current life pattern, I'm not gonna be healthy in some number of years. So I'm trying to see where I can draw the balance and make sure I remain healthy in the coming years.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: For you, what makes it easy or hard to stay healthy?\\n\\nJoon: You know, certainly the schedule, I think, really does make things a little bit difficult, right? I do skip some meals when things do get busy. My sleeping schedule, I think, is fairly shifted, like shifted to be a fairly, like, go to bed pretty late. Sometimes I don't get eight hours. I really try to get eight hours, but sometimes that's a little bit more challenging. So that's been sort of the main challenge. I would like to get some more exercise. I think that's something that I've been trying to do and meaning to do for a long time, but some challenges there.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me about anything big that has happened in the past two years related to your health: any medical diagnoses, flare-ups of chronic conditions, broken bones, pain – anything like that.\\n\\nJoon: Luckily, no. I mean, I remained healthy, so I feel good.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Sometimes, health problems get in the way. They can even affect people’s ability to work or care for their children. How about you?\\n\\nJoon: Yup, I've been good.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: I'm glad to hear you're doing well! Could you share a bit more about your daily routine and if you face any health challenges that might affect your work or other responsibilities?\\n\\nJoon: Luckily, no, I really have been remaining healthy, at least so far. Nothing that happened that sort of impacts my work, at least for now.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Sometimes, it’s not your health problem, but the health of a loved one. Has this been an issue for you?\\n\\nJoon: Luckily, no. I mean, I'm a little bit concerned for my dad because he smokes. That's been sort of a long-time concern, but he's been healthy so far. So we, I hope it, you know, I hope that's going to continue to be the case. But otherwise, no, I've been lucky to have a healthy family.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me what it has been like trying to get the health care you or your immediate family need. Have you ever had to forgo getting the health care you need?\\n\\nJoon: No, we do have health care, luckily. Also, yeah, I didn't really need health care in the recent years. I'm grateful for that.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Have you or your immediate family ever used alternative forms of medicine? This might include indigenous, non-western, or informal forms of care.\\n\\nJoon: Nothing like that for now.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: During tough times, some people tell us they cope by smoking or drinking. How about for you?\\n\\nJoon: I generally do believe good night's sleep, I think, sort of cares, takes care of a lot of things. So that's what I believe in. I need to think, I do walk around quite a bit, or I used to really like doing that. Obviously, nowadays, I'm a little bit more constrained time-wise. So I draw on my, you know, sketch pad or something just to, you know, keep my mind off of things. But that's what I usually do. And, you know, a beer or a shot of whiskey here and there, but that's not a big part of my life.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Other people say they cope by relying on prescriptions, pain medications, marijuana, or other substances. How about for you and can you describe your most recent experience of using them, if any?\\n\\nJoon: No, I don't use anything. Yeah, it's just as I mentioned.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: I understand. Have you ever had any experiences using prescriptions, pain medications, or other substances in the past, even if you don't rely on them now? Or is there a particular reason you prefer to cope through sleep, walking, and drawing instead?\\n\\nJoon: I never used it. I generally don't like the idea of becoming dependent on some external coping mechanisms that to me doesn't feel as sustainable. I think it's fine for some drugs like marijuana. If people want to use them, that's totally fine, I think. It's legal now, but I don't use them myself.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: How are you and your family coping with, or paying for, your health care needs right now?\\n\\nJoon: Luckily I do not have any healthcare needs and I hope it stays that way.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: That's good to hear that you haven't needed healthcare recently. You mentioned that you're concerned about your dad's smoking habit; has your family had to manage any healthcare needs related to that or anything else? How do you ensure that your family stays healthy and manages any potential healthcare costs?\\n\\nJoon: So far, no. He's been healthy. I mean, as a family, I think we didn't have any medical scare. I mean, it's only three members, two, and both of them are medical doctors. I think it's hopefully they know what they're doing. So no.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people are excited about medical vaccination, and others, not so much. How about you?\\n\\nJoon: I think vaccination is important. I mean, I think it's a fantastic way to, you know, prevent large scale illness and for individuals as well. So yes, I find it to be an important part of our health strategy.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What are your trusted sources of information about the vaccine?\\n\\nJoon: I usually listen to my mom, especially her medical field and research field, in the past at least I had fairly closely, it was closely related to some of these topics, so I listen to her.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: That's great to hear. In addition to your mom, are there any other sources or platforms, like government health websites, scientific journals, or trusted news outlets, that you rely on for information about the Covid-19 vaccine?\\n\\nJoon: Stanford, my current institution, does send out, what is it, you know, notifications. So I usually listen to them. I trust, you know, the community here.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Now we’re going to talk a bit more about what life was like for you over the past year. Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\\n\\nJoon: I've been feeling good. I mean, there's sort of a day-to-day stress in the sense that, you know, being a researcher, you don't really know. I think the most fun part of being a researcher is that you don't know what's going to happen the next day, like with your experiment and with your direction, whether you're going the right direction or not. But at the same time, that can be quite daunting in some ways. So it's a bit of a, you know, they're both sides to that. But otherwise, I've been doing well.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me a story about a time in the last year when you were in a rough place or struggling emotionally.\\n\\nJoon: So there's a current paper that we're working on that we just submitted. It was a tough one. It sort of had a lot of members on the team, and they contributed many great ideas, but correlating every opinion into sort of one narrative, right? And some of them were very vocal about things, too. And I think there's sort of a lot of uncertainty as to whether this is the right direction, whether this is rigorous enough. So there was a lot of challenge with that. And it does cause a lot of sort of emotional struggle as well as sort of a mental and intellectual struggle. But it's part of the job. It's part of research. So I take it as what it is. But again, that's what makes it fun. That's why I want to come back to work, because I want to see what happens tomorrow. And that's what keeps me going. So I think it's, you know, you get both.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people say they struggle with depression, anxiety, or something else like that. How about for you?\\n\\nJoon: No, nothing like that. I've been fairly stable in that sense. No anxiety, depression. That's sort of worth mentioning. I mean, I get stressed sometimes, but you know, like everyone.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: It's great to hear that you haven't experienced anxiety or depression. You mentioned feeling stressed sometimes, which is quite common. Could you tell me a bit more about what usually triggers that stress for you and how you manage it?\\n\\nJoon: You know, I mean, it's the relatively, I think, obvious things like, you know, research has its own uncertainties that you need to navigate, which is both fun but also can be a little bit daunting at times. Managing people in that way, in that context, I think you sort of need to have the balance between the care but also sort of the discipline to push the project through. So balancing that doesn't require care, and you sort of want to do a good job doing that. So I think there is that responsibility. So just those kind of things, but nothing too sort of special in that sense.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you face in your research and how you handle them.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people say that religion or spirituality is important in their lives, for others not so much. How about you?\\n\\nJoon: Not so much for me.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: That's interesting to hear. I'm curious, what are the main sources of support or guidance you find meaningful in your life? Are there particular philosophies, practices, or communities that provide you with a sense of purpose or direction?\\n\\nJoon: I originally got my training as an artist, and I think I always had a little bit of that flavor to the work that I do, where the things I do, the way I live, the way I create, even research papers, is a form of expression, and that inherently has to do with taste. What kind of things are you drawn by? What do you find beautiful? So you pursue that to the best of your ability, and looking back, you hope that the path you took will have had a meaning, but it's a little bit hard to tell what kind of meaning those paths will have. Looking forward, it's much more clear when you look backward. So I think what I usually try to do is believe that things will sort of point to a future that to me is fulfilling, and have the courage to say, you know, I just keep walking, even though things might be a little bit rough, things might be tiring now, and so forth.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people tell us they use Facebook, Instagram, or other social media to stay connected with the wider world. How about for you? Tell me all about how you use these types of platforms.\\n\\nJoon: My academic community seems to really like Twitter, so I use Twitter just to keep in touch with my professional colleagues and the work that they're doing. So when they write new papers, they tend to share on Twitter. There's sort of a huge also AI community on Twitter for whatever reason that has become sort of the main platform. So I do check Twitter. I'm not a social media person, even though I have in the past studied social media as a part of my research. I don't really like using social media too much, so I don't really use Facebook. I mean, I do post on Instagram every once in a while. I sort of have an artist account. So yeah, but that's the extent of it.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people say they use Facebook or Twitter to get (emotional or financial) support during tough times. What about you?\\n\\nJoon: No, nothing like that, especially, yeah, I don't tend to be very expressive in that way. When things are tough, I tend to deal with things more internally and get support from sort of my closest friends and family members, but I don't really express it publicly. I try not to, at least, and I've been fairly good at doing, you know, being fairly restricting in that way.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me about any recent changes in your level of stress, worry, and your emotional coping strategies.\\n\\nJoon: No, there hasn't been much change. For me, it's been fairly consistent over the years. Good night's sleep, I think, does matter. But it's usually much more introspective. I try to find out what is the root cause of what's giving me the stress. Usually, for me, for instance, when something is not working in my research and that's stressful, I think it's often easy to get disheartened by that. But I think what I've found over the years is, keep walking forward despite the uncertainty or the stress is oftentimes the best way to go about things. That's what gets you the result. That's what keeps you moving and less worried. So that's what I usually do. I go back to the fundamentals. That's my coping strategy.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: This might be repetitive, but before we go on to the next section, I want to quickly make sure I have this right: who are you living with right now?\\n\\nJoon: Uh, no one. Just alone.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Anyone who usually lives here but is away – traveling, at school, or in a hospital?\\n\\nJoon: Nope.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Thanks for confirming that.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Who shares the responsibility for the rent, mortgage, or other household expenses?\\n\\nJoon: No one. I mean, my parents sometimes help me out if need be, but I can mostly cover those.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Now we’d like to talk about how you make ends meet and what the monthly budget looks like for you and your family. What were your biggest expenses last month?\\n\\nJoon: Likely the rent. Yeah, the rent here is not cheap. It's Palo Alto. You know, I have an apartment, so it's downtown Palo Alto, so it's not a cheap place to live. I mean, also, I don't really spend money other than that, so it has to be actually that.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Does your household own or rent your home?\\n\\nJoon: I live, I rent an apartment.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Renting in Palo Alto must come with its set of challenges and benefits. Can you share more about your experience renting there and whether you've considered owning a home in the future?\\n\\nJoon: I mean, things are fairly overpriced for what they offer. I mean, maybe not overpriced. I mean, maybe it is the right price given the location. So that's, I mean, the pricing is definitely the main challenge. But no, I haven't... I think there was a brief time when we considered owning a place somewhere around Palo Alto. But no, we haven't gone through with that. So no, not really. But maybe I should buy a place soon. Or not soon, but at some point. Thank you.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Bills can fluctuate over the course of a year. Seasons change, there are holidays and special events, school starts and ends, and so on. Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\\n\\nJoon: It really doesn't, right. I mean, yeah, no, it's mostly just food expenses and rent. I mean, I do need to buy plane tickets because I do go back to Korea. My parents are now back in Korea, so I go see them every winter, so there's that. So I need to buy like plane tickets, so that spikes some pricing, but otherwise.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me all about how you coped with any extra expenses in the past months.\\n\\nJoon: We didn't have that much extra expenses.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: I understand that you mentioned there haven't been many extra expenses recently. In general, how do you manage your finances when unexpected costs do arise, like the plane tickets to Korea or any other unplanned expenses?\\n\\nJoon: I'm not young enough to be dependent on my parents, but because I am technically a student and grad student, salary can be fairly limiting, I do still get some financial help from my parents, or I have in the past. In the recent years, I have some savings saved up from various other things that have come along the way that I don't really have to worry too much about this.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people save for big things, like a home, while others save for a rainy day. How about for you (in the last year)?\\n\\nJoon: To be honest, I don't really think too much about this. Maybe for a rainy day.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that. When you mention saving for a rainy day, do you have any particular scenarios in mind? For example, are there unexpected expenses, like health emergencies, or opportunities, like travel, that you might be saving for?\\n\\nJoon: I mean, I can see emergencies arise, although by definition, I don't exactly know what they're gonna be. But in general, I don't really have any like unforeseen expenses in my life. My life has been very consistent over the past quite some number of years. My general life philosophy is because things in my like day-to-day work and research can be so unstable, I try to make everything else to be extremely stable.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Your approach to keeping a stable life outside of your research makes a lot of sense. Thank you for sharing this with me.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Some people have student loans or credit card debt. Others take out loans from family or friends or find other ways of borrowing money. Tell me about all the debts you’re paying on right now.\\n\\nJoon: I do not have any.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me about any time during the past year that you haven’t had enough money to buy something that you needed or pay a bill that was due.\\n\\nJoon: There wasn't a time like that.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're managing your finances quite well. Could you share some of the strategies or habits you use to ensure you never run into a situation where you can't cover your expenses?\\n\\nJoon: My expenses don't really change, so it's very predictable. I know my range and I try to keep it there.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What is or was your occupation? In this occupation, what kind of work do you do and what are the most important activities or duties?\\n\\nJoon: I'm a researcher in computer science, focusing on AI, human-computer interaction. In particular, I study AI agents, generative agents, simulations. Really this job has to do with pushing the boundary of our knowledge, you know, finding new paradigms for research, development, and so forth. So that's what I do.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: In the past year, how many weeks did you work (for a few hours, including paid vacation, paid sick leave, and military service)?\\n\\nJoon: Every week. So what is that, like 52?\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: How many hours each week did you usually work?\\n\\nJoon: 70 to 90 plus minus.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: In the past week, did you work for pay (even for 1 hour) at a job or business?\\n\\nJoon: Yes, PhD is a paid position.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Did you have more than one job or business, including part time, evening, or weekend work?\\n\\nJoon: Nope, I just am a PhD student.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Now, in the past month, how many jobs did you work, including part time, evening, or weekend work?\\n\\nJoon: Just one\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: For your job or occupations, how much money did you receive in the past month?\\n\\nJoon: What about your grad student salary plus I do some, I do events like speaking events and those kind of things. So they pay money sometimes.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: How often do you get paid?\\n\\nJoon: Once a month, events are, you know, one by one, one-off.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Switching gears a bit, let’s talk a little about tax time. Did you file taxes last year (the most recent year)?\\n\\nJoon: I did.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: That’s good to hear. Were there any particular challenges or difficulties you encountered while filing your taxes? And did you handle it yourself, or did you seek assistance from a professional?\\n\\nJoon: We have an accountant.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me more about your workplace. How long have you been at your current job? How would you describe the benefits that come with your job? (This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\\n\\nJoon: So I've been a PhD student here for now, this is my fifth year. And I mean, I think we get like in a health care and those kind of things. But really, the main benefit is the ability to sort of work with, you know, really smart colleagues and, you know, learn from them and so forth. And I find that to be the main benefit.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: How would you describe your relationships at work? (How is your relationship with your manager or boss? How are your relationships with your coworkers?)\\n\\nJoon: Yeah, no, I mean, we don't really have bosses per se. We have advisors, but no, they're my closest mentor. So it's been great. I don't think I would have had the career I did without them. So kudos to them.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Tell me about how predictable your work schedule is. How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\\n\\nJoon: It's really unpredictable, right? Because again, with research, you really don't know at what stage, like, what's going to happen. So sometimes, sometimes maybe you thought you'd be done with this experiment, but you find out that something is not quite working or you need to do a little bit more conceptual thinking, then you go back to the drawing board and, you know, redo a lot of the work that you've done. Whereas sometimes things move much quicker, right? And then there are times when, you know, you know, obviously there are deadlines, so when deadline approaches, then you can sort of expect yourself to be writing a lot, so that's sort of its own sort of, you know, thing. So it's really hard to predict. You don't know what's going to happen. And that's what makes it fun.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Do you receive any payments or benefits from SNAP, food stamps, housing voucher payments, supplemental security income, or any other programs like that?\\n\\nJoon: I do not.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What would it be like for you if you had to spend $400 for an emergency? Would you have the money, and if not, how would you get it?\\n\\nJoon: I have enough saved up that I don't think 400 is sort of a spending that I would be particularly distressed about. So yeah, it should be okay.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Overall, how do you feel about your financial situation?\\n\\nJoon: I feel comfortable. I mean, it's not like I make a lot of money as a grad student, but overall, I have nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling comfortable with your finances. Do you have any specific financial goals or plans for the future, such as saving for a large purchase, investing, or preparing for eventual career transitions?\\n\\nJoon: I think for now, I'm a little bit less concerned about the sort of financial aspect, I think, of my career and more about sort of, you know, making sure that my research is interesting and fruitful. \\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Are you now married, widowed, divorced, separated, or have you never been married? If you are not currently married, are you currently living with a romantic partner?\\n\\nJoon: I'm not married. And I'm living alone.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: For our records, we also need your date of birth. Could you please provide that?\\n\\nJoon: I was born in 1994, February 18th.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Were you born in the United States? If you were not born in the U.S., what country were you born, and what year did you first come to the U.S. to live?\\n\\nJoon: I was not born in the U.S., I was born in Korea. What year did I come first? So I came when I was like 11 or so. So that must have been 19 years ago, almost 20 years ago. So, yeah, it must have been like 2007, 2008, 2007 maybe, or something like that, 2006, in that range.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What city and state were you born in?\\n\\nJoon: I was just born in Seoul.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Are you of Hispanic, Latinx, or Spanish origin?\\n\\nJoon: No.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What race or races do you identify with?\\n\\nJoon: I'm an Asian.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What is the highest degree or grade you’ve completed?\\n\\nJoon: I completed my master's degree before my Ph.D.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Are you enrolled in school?\\n\\nJoon: Yes, as a Ph.D. student.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Have you been enrolled in school during the past 3 months?\\n\\nJoon: As a PhD student.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Have you ever served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves, or National Guard?\\n\\nJoon: No. \\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What religion do you identify with, if any?\\n\\nJoon: None.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What was the city and state that you lived in when you were 16 years old?\\n\\nJoon: I was living in Concord, New Hampshire.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Did you live with both your own mother and father when you were 16?\\n\\nJoon: No, I was at a boarding school.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Who else did you live with?\\n\\nJoon: I lived in a dorm so I had dorm mates, roommates...\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What’s the highest degree or grade your dad completed?\\n\\nJoon: MD, PhD.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What’s the highest degree or grade your mom completed?\\n\\nJoon: She's also an MD PhD.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Did your mom work for pay for at least a year while you were growing up?\\n\\nJoon: Yep, she did.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What was her job? What kind of work did she do? What were her most important activities or duties?\\n\\nJoon: So when I was young, my parents had just finished their degree program. It turns out if you're an MD-PhD, you sort of need to decide whether you're going to be more of a medical doctor or a researcher. My dad was a surgeon and he became a professor. My mom went to more of an industry path in medicine.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What kind of place did she work for? What kind of business was it? What did they make or do where she worked?\\n\\nJoon: She worked at the Red Cross. She was trained as a clinical pathologist. And then, when she started her post doc, she was at Harvard Medical School and went into stem cell research. I think during her time there, she worked on using \\u200b\\u200binduced pluripotent stem cells to culture photoreceptors. \\n\\n\\nInterviewer: Did your dad work for pay for at least a year while you were growing up?\\n\\nJoon: Yes.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What was his job? What kind of work did he do? What were his most important activities or duties?\\n\\nJoon: He was a cardio surgeon, so I think a lot of the operations he performed were for genetic diseases in the heart.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What kind of place did he work for? What kind of business was it? What did they make or do where he worked?\\n\\nJoon: He worked for a university hospital. So his main position was in Korea. So he was there. And then when he was in Boston, he was at the Boston Children's Hospital.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: We all have hopes about what our future will look like. Imagine yourself a few years from now. Maybe you want your life to be the same in some ways as it is now. Maybe you want it to be different in some ways. What do you hope for?\\n\\nJoon: You know, the work I do on AI agents and, you know, and human-computer interaction, it means a lot to me. What I hope is in the years to come, this field grows into a field that actually has a certain impact, that is positive and impactful to people's lives. Especially the work that we're sort of leading has to do with this idea of simulations, right? Simulating human lives and societies so that we can better test out policies and social scientific theories. And my hunch is that if you can do that really well, there's going to be a huge opportunity to empower our society in the way we sort of navigate the wicked challenges and so forth. That really excites me. Doing a sort of a, you know, doing our work so that we can lay the foundation in that line of work and being a, you know, meaningful and fruitful steward of the field, that matters a lot to me. I do care a lot about sort of the artistic passion in the sense that, I mean, this is all a creative process. So I do think many of the things, when I look back, a lot of, I look back to the work that I've done as sort of, you know, and to get the sense of whether, you know, the path I took was a fruitful one. And I think it's so long as it's true to me and the way I sort of decided to live. I think that's what matters. So that's what I hope. I do one day, you know, like to, you know, live somewhere quieter, maybe in the mountains or, you know, somewhere like that. And, you know, maybe have a small, you know, cafe or something. I joke about that, but I think there's some elements of truth in that. I really do sort of admire slightly more idyllic lifestyle too. So maybe someday, maybe I can paint and stuff like that, if ever comes to that. Thank you.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What do you value the most in your life?\\n\\nJoon: I care a lot about the work that I do and the path I take, sort of the journey I take when I personally look back, I care a little bit, I don't really care too much about sort of the eyes of the society per se, but when I look back, again, I want to make sure that the path I've taken is sort of true to myself and I can look back to it and be proud that I've done the work that, you know, that I think is meaningful, that I think is impactful. And, of course, I care about people around me. You know, I don't have a lot of close friends or acquaintances, but the ones who are close to me are very close to me, and I care a lot about them and making sure that I can support them in the future and continue to do so. So that's what I care about.\\n\\n\", \"Q: Do you enjoy outdoor activities?\\nOption: ['Yes', 'No', 'Sometimes']\"] \n",

      "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Right. So I was born in Korea. I lived there for the first 12 years or so of my life. And my parents and I moved to Boston. So my parents were pursuing their postdoctoral degree. They're both medical doctors. So we moved to Boston. So we lived there for five years. And then I went to high school in New Hampshire after that, college in Pennsylvania, called Swarthmore College. It's a liberal arts college. And towards the end of my college years, one other co-founder and I started to run a startup. So while we were running that, as we were graduating, we moved to Palo Alto. So we lived by somebody's garage, actually, for about a year. The typical thing that you do if you're into that. The startup itself didn't pan out. But during that year, I got to know this group of researchers and community in the computer science department at Stanford, just by through some luck and just, yeah, through pure luck. And I started to work on some research projects with them. So I spent about a half a year, a little bit more than maybe half a year working with them. And then I went to get my master's in computer science at UIUC, that's Illinois Urbana-Champaign. So I spent two years of my life there. And when I was finishing that up, I moved back to Palo Alto, started my PhD as a computer science PhD student at Stanford. And I've been here since then. So this is my year five of doing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that overview! I'd love to learn more about your experiences. Can you tell me what it was like for you adjusting to life in Boston after moving from Korea? What were some of the challenges you faced during that transition?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: It's a good question. Well, moving to a different country and different culture for any child and their parents, it's a heavy lift. But I think likely what was sort of the most interesting was the fact that the entire family, to some extent, was sort of at this point where they were all trying to figure out their career and so forth. My dad actually was already a professor by then and it was sort of his sabbatical years he was spending, so he likely was the most settled amongst us. But certainly for my mom, she was pursuing a postdoctoral degree, so she was transitioning more towards the medical research, the academic research side of things, at least in her discipline. So I think she was really trying to do this sort of a superhuman thing of trying to figure out her new career path, what research areas she wanted to be involved in, while trying to raise a teenager in a new country. So I think that was sort of an interesting period for her and for my parents. And that moment of transition does trickle down to obviously the child as well. So I grew up sort of seeing them trying to figure those kind of things out with a lot of uncertainty. They weren't, I don't think, even sure whether they wanted to stay in the US in sort of the American academic system or sort of head back to Korea, where they sort of could just get a professorship there. So I think they were all trying to figure that out. Maybe as a side effect of that, maybe because of the uncertainty, for some reason, I took this habit of walking around the town quite a bit, often alone. I lived in this small town called Newton. It's a small town in the suburban area of Boston. It's a beautiful place. And I would just walk around and try to sort of get away from things. So that was a transition. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: That sounds like a challenging but formative period in your life. You mentioned that you used to walk around a lot to deal with the uncertainties. How did those walks and that time of reflection shape you as a person? Did it have any lasting impact on how you approach new situations or challenges?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: It did. It's a habit that I formed fairly early on and, you know, it's a habit that sort of lasted throughout sort of my teenage years, all the way through high school and parts of college. Obviously, you know, once you're in college, you know, life sort of, you know, takes you in other directions. So you sometimes cannot hang on to your old habits. But certainly when I was a teenager, I'm walking around different places, I think was sort of a big part. It's a good question. I, you know, you think about, you know, some random things, right? I mean, you know, like, what are sort of the main axioms that you want to sort of hold on to in your life? I think sort of the thoughts that I had, I, the way sort of I internalize myself at this point, so I'm now 30, is that I haven't really changed much as a person since I was, let's say, maybe 16 or so. And I think most of the decisions about who I am and who I was going to be, I think I sort of made during those years. I do care a lot about seasons. They just, you know, in season and like nature, right? So Boston and New Hampshire, these areas, you know, there's a lot of snow. So the winter is snowy and brutal, but beautiful in sort of a, you know, very sort of stern way. Spring is bright and you can sort of smell the end of the winter and you can smell the flowers. Summer can be very hot and humid. I sort of grew up being used to humid summers because Korea and I spent some part of my life in Japan as well. And those places have very humid summer. And it was the same for Boston and New Hampshire. Fall, you know, the Boston and New Hampshire falls are beautiful, like one of the most beautiful autumn autumnal sort of places that you can ever find. So, you know, I grew up watching the seasons change and I think it's sort of the nice thing about, you know, I think in part because my parents were also busy, so they didn't really care about what I was doing during the day. Right. Many Asian parents care a lot about what their kids do during the day. My parents didn't really care. So they sort of let me do whatever I wanted to do. That was the case for high school as well. I went to  a boarding school and, you know, in boarding school, sometimes there's, you know, you can be a little bit more free? So I would just walk around the pond or the forest and stuff like that. So there was sort of less supervision in terms of what I could do or what I ought to do. And, you know, I spent most of my time basically sort of in the nature, changing, you know, seeing how the seasons change and all these kind of things. And I don't know what concretely like that, you know, had an impact on other than the fact that I think it had, you know, to me, it feels like that was a very core part of who I was? Something about seeing the nature and seasons change, come and go, and everything repeats, sort of puts you in perspective about like, you know, that, you know, there's the circulatory fractal structure to the life that we live. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Thank you for sharing all that. It sounds like those walks and the changing seasons had a profound impact on you. Could you tell me more about your time in high school and college—what were some of the formative experiences or relationships that influenced your path towards a career in computer science and research?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: So I was not a computer scientist for most of my childhood and through most of my college years, maybe halfway through college years, I transitioned, but I actually, I was into art and sort of, well, art and music at first. I mean, I was really into music when I was growing up, classical music. I played the violin, sort of the way I describe it as, you know, I wasn't particularly talented in music, but I was really passionate about it. And I spent a lot of hours. So like from middle school to high school, I would practice, you know, three, four hours a day. You know, I sort of saw it as a core part of, you know, who I am, like how I was viewed. Many people sort of, many, you know, friends during those era, not that I had that many friends, but, you know, many friends during that time sort of saw me as, oh, you're the guy who plays the violin, you're the guy who's in the orchestra. So that was sort of a fundamental part of who I was. I wasn't talented again. So, you know, I think there's, I don't think I really had a career in that profession, but I was drawn to those kinds of things. On the side, I would draw a lot. I think, you know, one of the things that I really loved doing was, you know, taking walks and then sort of drawing what I saw, you know, out in nature. I also really like, I don't like, I never really, you know, was sort of the social person or like very like outgoing person. I was very introverted throughout my childhood. And even now I'm very introverted. Although my career does ask me to be a little bit more outgoing nowadays by definition. I was very introverted by nature. So I never really liked talking to people, but I really like observing them. And I made a lot of drawings and paintings of people. And that was always really fun and, you know, a fundamental part of what I really enjoyed during that time. So I did a lot of that. So again, go out, draw, you know, and take photos. I took a lot of photos. And then during that time, one of sort of the high school teacher who was a supervisor in the dorm that I lived, saw one of my drawings and he was the art teacher at our school. And I never took art classes. I didn't know that this was a thing I could do. And he just thought I was drawing for hobby. And then he saw my drawings and he was like, hmm, okay, you're. Well, it sort of started. So, you know, these dorm advisors, they would come once a week. They take rotation every night. And during the nights when he's on rotation, he would come and we would chat and he would bring like these art books and lend them to me. And he was like, hey, you know what you've done here with this art or with this drawing is really interesting in this ways, you know, take a look at this or that, right. So he would do a lot of that, which was really in many ways fortunate for me, obviously. So we spent a lot of time doing that. And then after about half a year to a year, he told me, OK, you're you should join my art class. And I did. And I sort of started sort of a semi-career in art. I mean, you know, I wasn't professional back then, but I was very interested. And I think everyone sort of quickly got the sense that this guy was actually good. You know, he was sort of there is something unusual about the way I sort of went about doing art. So I think they sort of tried to at least get me exposed to more of that environment. And when I went to college, I initially started because of that, perhaps as an art and sociology major. And that continued for most of my time during college. So I was an art major. So I, again, was the guy who spent a lot of time in the studio. So most of times I'd be sort of in this, you know, in this very ragged clothes with a bunch of paint, you know, stains on it and so forth. So I was, you know, a little bit of that character. And so I spent quite a number of hours doing that. And I gradually became fairly, you know, it became clear that, you know, this could actually be a professional career. And interesting thing about my parents was sort of that they were actually OK with that. They actually thought you could actually make or they at least they thought that I could at least make money doing this for whatever reason. And I wouldn't disagree with it. And, you know, I thought we had a shot. So I started to pursue that. But somewhere along the way, I got deeply interested in sort of this more of a technical project. Again, this is where computer science comes in. A technical project where, you know, I had an idea for a startup was sort of all related to self-expression and so forth. So I think there's some obvious thread that we were trying to tie together. And that required technical expertise. So I started to take some computer science courses. So there was a bit of a, you know, undergrad, you know, you're trying to figure out what you want to do. And as I was trying to figure out, oh, am I going to do art? Or is there something else? And I wanted to at least try this out. And I went and Swarthmore was sort of a, you know, this college where they would let you explore different things fairly late on. So they would actually let me take intro to computer science courses and let me double major. So I had to drop sociology, but I got to major in computer science and art at the same time for that time. So I kept on doing that. And when I was graduating, we thought we sort of had a product together. So we decided to just go for it. So it turns out, you know, the work that I ended up doing, so I mean, again, I'm a researcher now, but the work I ended up doing actually is very much like art, right? In the sense that, you know, you write papers, but writing papers is very much like making art pieces and publishing it, right? You get to work on an idea for a long time. It means a lot to you. And it's an expression of, you know, what you experience and so forth. And you get to sort of stamp your name on it and send it out. And that was always sort of a fascinating part of that experience. So that's, I'd say, how that sort of all led to where this is.\n",

      "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: It's an interesting question. I enjoyed my time as a researcher and my professional career, I think. I've been very happy with this journey. But what's interesting about the journey that I've taken, or at least the way I perceive my life, was for whatever reason, I never really had that many options. In each sort of moments of my life, in retrospect, I always felt like I got one choice. There wasn't much decision that had to be made where the choice was very obvious. Even all the way back to things like, for instance, where to go to high school and college. I wasn't particularly a good student in any sense of that word for most of my childhood. Maybe I was for some part of it, at least some part that actually mattered. But at the end of the day, I got accepted to one school that actually I would be interested in going. It wasn't sort of this, oh, I have many great options, maybe I can pick and choose. It wasn't quite that. I was like, no, you have one good option, you're going to take that. When I started my professional career, for a while, that actually was the case, too. And then when I was deciding where to be for my PhD career as well, that time, actually, I actually did have options. But my interest has sort of gotten focused enough that I didn't really seriously at some point start to consider other paths, other than, this is what I want to do, and the best place to do it actually here is going to be Stanford, and the people here. So that's how I felt about my journey. I don't know why this ended up being that way. But I always felt like I never really got that many options. And I think it was for the better. And I sort of have accepted that to be a factor of my life where, you know, things are going to happen. Every living moment, I try to do the best work that I can do. And whatever sort of comes next, there will be a path that will open up. And again, I don't expect there to be many paths that I need to, like many great paths that I need to mull over. Like one path will open up for the next stage. And I just need to walk through the door. But just make sure that I walk through it. Sometimes it was a little bit daunting. And I think my, I think there were moments where I sort of had a lot of hesitation, where, you know, the option was clear, but I was sort of afraid to walk through the door for various reasons, right. But sometimes, you know, that can be very daunting. I think I over the years had great set up in my, you know, my parents, especially my mom was sort of my early guide into many of these. But after that, I also had a lot of great mentors who sort of pushed me to make the right choices in these moments. So in that way, I think I was lucky to sort of have had that experience. But yeah, at the end of the day, that's how I see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that perspective. It sounds like you've had a clear sense of direction in your life. You mentioned moments of hesitation and fear when a clear option was ahead. Could you tell me about one such specific moment in more detail? What were the stakes, what caused the hesitation, and how did you eventually decide to move forward?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: So you know, when likely the most recent one, you know, was again, I told you that I'm a PhD student, this is my fifth year. And what was interesting was, you know, I wanted to do this research at the intersection of what we call human-computer interaction, AI, and so forth. I always had this view, and this was a little bit coming from my days as a, you know, when I was running startup. But I got the sense that in technology has ebbs and flows, right, where there are periods when technology is sort of in its infancy, but you think something is happening. But technology itself that has been developed during that time isn't ready for the primetime like industry market. During those times, sometimes there's a lot of boom in industry. So when I came into the scene, or when I sort of grew up, this is sort of 2005 to 2015, there was sort of a lot of excitement around, you know, the network, the internet, right, the social network, early sort of versions of social network was just being born. And then pretty soon, there were sort of these gig works that were born as an artifact of these networks. So there was a lot of those applications that were being really successful. But you know, when I was trying to go into the industry was around 2017, and that market was sort of in its, you know, it was very successful, the market was big, but all the known players or what will be the known players were already sort of set in place. So there weren't that many opportunities to crack into that space. But another sort of absent flow that was happening was the research that was sort of in its dormant, like in early stages, when all that movement in industry was going on, especially on AI was actually about to start working, and there was 17 and 18. Like AI didn't really work right before 2014, before ImageNet, and so forth, and before the neural net and all this development. I started to sense, especially, I don't know, the magical part of being in the bear, yeah, was, you know, I sort of got the visceral sense in my body that something was about to change. And, you know, this was the magical part, interestingly, was actually, this wasn't really by talking to anyone, even, or, you know, reading research papers, I was not a researcher back then. So I didn't know anything about this. But just by living in the area, and sort of seeing, you know, people move around, they start to get this sense that, oh, something is about to work. But it wasn't quite there yet, right, it was 2017. So it was before GPT, like all this, like generative AI excitement. So I decided, this might actually be a good time to do research. So I decided, well, so I go do that. So I got very excited by this human-computer interaction and AI area. Because I thought, given my skillset, trying to understand, like, condition the fact that AI might soon work and end its sort of research phase, when would it be the time? What would be the application that AI can really support that's going to be transformative? And given my experience, especially, you know, with the startup and, you know, with my other backgrounds, I realized that that intersection seemed fantastically interesting. For that work, the right place to do that work was, to me, Stanford, right? It was near the industry. And so there was a lot of proximity to many of these exciting research, but also the influence from industry. And at the same time, there were a group of scholars in this space, who ended up becoming my advisors and mentors, who were doing the work that, to me, was sort of the most exciting and inspiring during that era, that, you know, wasn't necessarily AI even sometimes. One of my advisors, Michael Bernstein, you know, he was working on cross-sourcing, Percy Liang. I don't think I yet have been, when I was sort of an undergrad and master's, I haven't yet been sort of introduced to his work yet. But the sense I got was some of the work that they were doing in these different spaces, you know, if something felt right, that a lot of the things that we learned during that era and in these other fields would transfer over as we start thinking about how to apply AI to different applications. So that really got me excited. So, you know, after my master's, the right place to do my PhD, to me, was always internally fairly obvious that I was going to be at Stanford. The scary part is that, well, that means I need to go to Stanford and be amongst all of these amazing colleagues. And what's fun about this is, you know, I got in, right, and I think advisors seem to have had some confidence that I might be a good student. But, you know, that's totally different than now you actually have to join and actually stand next to all these amazing researchers who you've looked up to for many years and that you know they've done great work and you sort of question yourself, like, can I actually do the work? Can I perform at the level where, you know, I would actually make impact, that I wouldn't embarrass myself, that I wouldn't disappoint these sets of really great colleagues. And that scares you. I mean, it certainly scared me. It doesn't stop me, which I think was good. At the same time, I think there were people who ended up giving sort of really good advice. The person who sort of I'm still grateful for, like, there's, I have a mentor named Merrie Morris, and she, Merrie was the first person who told me to just go to Stanford. I don't know why, I don't think she like fully explained her rationale. But she told me, because in part, I was sort of thinking of maybe I can stay at University of Illinois, because you know, I know this environment, it's a great research program. And Merrie told me, well, you've already learned. So it's a good thing to move institutions between programs, right between your master's and then PhD. So go to Stanford. And I listened to Merrie. She was like, actually the only person who said that like straight to my face, like, you know, go to Stanford, or not go to Stanford directly, but like, you know, very strongly implied that it might be a good idea. And I followed her advice. And, you know, and that ended up being a really good decision, in the sense that I got to do the work that I, you know, the type of work that I really wanted to do. And it's been a very exciting journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Some people tell us they made a conscious choice or decision in moments like these, while others say it 'just happened'. What about you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I thought deeply about this, so all the decisions I made, I don't make them at random. I think deeply about it, and when I decide something is a good idea, then it's a very conscious choice. But at the same time, I think the options that were presented to me were presented in a way where any clear thinker would find one right solution, that there wasn't this many options that I can compare against and ponder about. So that's how I saw it. So I think the options that were presented to me sort of happened on their own, but I did reflect on why the option that was presented had the right answer, and that was internalized very explicitly and consciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you think another person or an organization could have lent a helping hand during moments like this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I'm not sure about organization, but maybe. But my career has really been shaped by many mentors. Early on and even today, my mom did play the role of a professional mentor, in part because she was a researcher. She's a PhD, she's a researcher in a completely different field. She doesn't know what I do, but she sort of understand the cultural context. And she was in fact the first person who recommended to me that I try this out. I think for whatever reason, she thought I might be good at it. She told me, you know, I know you, I know you well enough. I think you'd be good at research. So pursue it and gave me some pointers as to how I might start doing that. I don't think I, you know, I think if I had sort of one superpower, it was having sort of the set of mentors and guides in my life who gave me these advice. And I was very good at discerning what were sort of the advice that I ought to listen to and I follow through with them, right? So I think that was my superpower, which is like I had good set of people giving me mentorship. I appreciated who the good mentors were and what were the good advice. And when I made the promise that, yes, I'll deliver on this or yes, I follow through on this, I did. And that continued to be the case, right? So I mentioned this mentor, Merrie, who over the years had sort of profound impact on sort of how, in my view, my career really shaped up. During my master's, I had this mentor, Carrie Carajalios. She was my master's advisor, another person sort of who had a profound impact in the way sort of I went about building my career. And then Michael Bernstein and Percy Leung, like these advisors, I think sort of continue to play that role and many others. But yeah, so I think these people can always help. Another way of saying it is without them, it's, I don't think you really have a career, you so it's, you need them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Moving to present time, tell me more about family who are important to you. Do you have a partner, or children?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: So I have my parents. It's a small family so I'm the only child. They do, you know, they're a close family. Like I call them every week, you know. And again, they have been a great support. I don't think I, I was a child who, who needed some help in the sense that I am. I, you know, my, I think many of the ideas that I had I think were directionally all right. Right. So the ideas that I got while walking around the woods, certainly I think like that's still who I am. The thoughts I had in my like late middle school and high school era, like that is who I am even today. So I think they're true or at least have served me well. But the way you sort of marry that with reality, sometimes, you know, you need a little bit more finesse. My, my idea of a good life was to be self-sufficient. And then like I still have this book, Walden by Henry Thoreau. You know, like when I was growing up in Boston, I usually, every weekend I had my mom drive up to, drive me up to Walden Pond. You know, that's where, of course, Henry Thoreau wrote the book. And we would walk around. It's, you know, by, so we conquered where the Walden Pond is located. Really wasn't that far from where we lived. It's a beautiful town. I still love it. And, you know, one of the places where I would love to visit if I had the time. And, you know, my, my idea of a good life actually was be like that. Right. You know, sort of be self-sufficient to some extent, or maybe run a small shop, but, you know, in a small town, I actually still think that's actually a good life. And honestly, like, I think there's actually a fairly good chance that I might just do that at some point in my career. And, you know, when I feel like I might work here, it's mostly done. And I think I'd be very happy doing that even now. But, you know, there are certain things that you cannot explore unless you sort of, you know, venture out and actually do the rigorous work of making things happen as well. And I didn't really have any sense of that. I was, in some kids, I think, actually do have a sense of that, right? They know that, oh, you know, you do your sort of place in this context of society and so forth. So, you know, sometimes that actually comes more naturally to some people, it did not come naturally to me. So I need a lot of help there. So yeah. So that's what I would say. So there. So my again, my parents are important to me. And, yeah, in terms of partner and children, I do not have any kids, or I'm not married.\n",

My life generally has been one where I'm not very social or outgoing per se, but I usually retain very close but small circle of friends who know me very well, and they tend to stay for a long time. So there are some of those friends. We do spend time together, quite a bit of time, even nowadays. I do think it's actually a lot of work to maintain relationships of any kind, so I often also see this as sort of a big investment. So there are a few people like that, yeah.\n",

      "Joon: I live in Palo Alto. When I started my PhD program here at Stanford, I decided that I lived on campus for too long in my life. I lived on campus in a dorm for high school, college. I basically lived on campus for my master's. I was like, I'm really done doing this. So I decided to live off campus, but I don't drive. So I can't live too far outside the area. So I got an apartment near campus. It's about a five minute drive from Stanford. So really not too far away. And yeah, it's a nice town. I mean, it's Palo Alto, so it's, you know, there is okay food. I mean, everything is very overpriced, but I think it's sort of a nice place to be.\n",

      "Joon: The ups are fairly clear. Palo Alto is a beautiful town, very historic. It has served as sort of the epicenter of many of the technological revolution that has happened, at least in the professional community that I'm now a part of. So all that, fantastic. It is overpriced. So the living cost tends to be fairly high. The food tends to be fairly expensive for what they give you. So, you know.\n",

      "\n",
      "Joon: It changes a lot. So PhD life I've sort of found is very dynamic in the sense that every week you might be doing something different. Sometimes when it's sort of a deadline season, you're mostly, hopefully, in the writing mode. Other times you're brainstorming, you're meeting with people to get ideas, you're running experiments, building systems. So towards the end of, towards the latter year now of my PhD career, I sort of see things merge, right? So one day I need to be building a system, the next day I need to go back to writing for a different project or a different duty that I might have. There's also interesting amount of outreach, whether it's interview with other people or the media, to meeting people, to talk about my own research, and then there's more professional connection that you sort of need to build up over the years. It's certainly enjoyable. It's fun. I've had a lot of fun doing it, but it's very dynamic. So there's no sort of typical week anymore, but I'm usually in the lab seven days a week, I think, for most sort of hours. So I'm usually in the lab. I'm a night owl, so I come in around 11 a.m. or 12. I leave around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. \n",

      "Joon: So again, I'm a PhD student. That really means sort of you're a researcher with some, you know, every once in a while you might have teaching duties and other things as a student, but it really means you're a researcher. So I'm a PhD student at Stanford Computer Science Department. I work on research related to, actually agents is sort of the main area that I work on. So we do work around AI agents, generative agents, simulations. Working hours are long, or for me at least, it has become quite extended. So I'm, again, usually in the office every day, 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. I think is fairly typical on any given day. During the day I might come in and out for different meetings or other events, but yeah.\n",

      "Interviewer: Do you have other routines or responsibilities that you did not already share?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Again, so PhD students, it does assume a few different things. Again, research is the main part. This quarter, I am actually teaching a class. So I am now a teacher. And we're a professor, real role to some undergrad students. And that's very new and exciting. I've never done that before, but that's one duty that I've taken this quarter. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Tell me about any recent changes to your daily routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: No, I mean, no, in the sense that, like, it's been changing every day, almost, you know, at any, like, there's no, like, routine day as a PhD student, I feel like, but, well, I mean, this quarter, certainly, I actually, it did bring some changes. And I think one of the reasons why I feel like this quarter actually has been a little bit busier than usual, where I at least try to take one evening off, so I usually have sort of this big sort of high-stake meeting, like, it's advisor meeting for PhD students, it's a project meeting, mine's on Thursday, 2 p.m., and that's been the time. So for my PhD career, I, in the past, like, when I was younger, in, like, first and second year, I actually took the weekends, or maybe, like, Friday off, or something like that, I took a day or so off, but in the recent years, I tried at least to take Thursday evening off after the advisor meeting, I'm like, okay, at least for that day, I'm done now that I'm done with this really big-stake, like, meeting. I lost that, and that still was big, so I usually need to get back to some other kind of duty after that meeting, and that feels really new to me, and I sort of tried to figure out why that's the case. I think a big part of this, I'm teaching this quarter, as I mentioned, so I am developing this new course on AI agents and simulations. We never offered it, but we are offering it as a core CS and AI curriculum at Stanford, and it's sort of, you know, it's a decently-sized class, never been taught, the course material is sort of, I'm making as I go. It's been really fulfilling and gratifying, but at the same time, the workload is non-trivial, so adding that to my existing schedule certainly, I think, did a number on my calendar, so that's been sort of the recent change that happened.\n",

I'm curious about any academic perspectives or indirectly observed experiences you might have encountered through your studies or research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Yeah, there was sort of a sort of very well-known case of machine learning, like especially vision models being used to identify potential suspects and so forth. And many sort of have considered that to be a negative use case of that technology because of the known biases against certain populations or population or less represented in the data set. So, yeah, there's been very important and interesting work that's been going on. But I think there's just a lot more work that needs to be done to make sure that this technology can sort of be applied in a sort of a safe and ethical way to these fields. So I think there's a big discussion that's going on that have been going on for quite some number of years now, although I'm not sort of the most knowledgeable sort of the domain expert in that area.\n",

And in the past, have you participated in elections in other countries where you might have had the right to vote?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I follow the news very closely, or at least I used to, and then I got very stressful over the years, so maybe not as closely, or I try to at least be aware of the important topics that goes on so I can remain engaged and sensible. But I don't look at New York Times cover every day to find what's going on in politics. Other than that, no, when I was in Korea, I was too young to vote, and of course since then I've been in the U.S., so I didn't really get to vote then. So I'm sort of realizing that I never voted. That's kind of sad. Hopefully that's going to change soon.\n",

You know, the spectrum sort of changes in this nation, so maybe I can, you know, I think I'm sort of your sort of very classic sort of center left during the Obama era. That's how I sort of would describe myself. So in terms of politicians, sort of I, when Obama was running his first and second election, I think I sort of, you know, looking back, ideologically, I think I'm sort of the most aligned with that view. So I think that's how I would describe my political views. Center left during the 2008 and 2012 era.\n",

So I'm a little bit concerned actually sometimes about my health. I'm healthy now, but I feel like if I maintain my current life pattern, I'm not gonna be healthy in some number of years.

My sleeping schedule, I think, is fairly shifted, like shifted to be a fairly, like, go to bed pretty late. Sometimes I don't get eight hours. I really try to get eight hours, but sometimes that's a little bit more challenging. So that's been sort of the main challenge. I would like to get some more exercise.

      "Interviewer: Sometimes, it’s not your health problem, but the health of a loved one. Has this been an issue for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Luckily, no. I mean, I'm a little bit concerned for my dad because he smokes. That's been sort of a long-time concern, but he's been healthy so far. So we, I hope it, you know, I hope that's going to continue to be the case. But otherwise, no, I've been lucky to have a healthy family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Tell me what it has been like trying to get the health care you or your immediate family need. Have you ever had to forgo getting the health care you need?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: No, we do have health care, luckily. Also, yeah, I didn't really need health care in the recent years. I'm grateful for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you or your immediate family ever used alternative forms of medicine? This might include indigenous, non-western, or informal forms of care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Nothing like that for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: During tough times, some people tell us they cope by smoking or drinking. How about for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I generally do believe good night's sleep, I think, sort of cares, takes care of a lot of things. So that's what I believe in. I need to think, I do walk around quite a bit, or I used to really like doing that. Obviously, nowadays, I'm a little bit more constrained time-wise. So I draw on my, you know, sketch pad or something just to, you know, keep my mind off of things. But that's what I usually do. And, you know, a beer or a shot of whiskey here and there, but that's not a big part of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Other people say they cope by relying on prescriptions, pain medications, marijuana, or other substances. How about for you and can you describe your most recent experience of using them, if any?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: No, I don't use anything. Yeah, it's just as I mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: I understand. Have you ever had any experiences using prescriptions, pain medications, or other substances in the past, even if you don't rely on them now? Or is there a particular reason you prefer to cope through sleep, walking, and drawing instead?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I never used it. I generally don't like the idea of becoming dependent on some external coping mechanisms that to me doesn't feel as sustainable. I think it's fine for some drugs like marijuana. If people want to use them, that's totally fine, I think. It's legal now, but I don't use them myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: How are you and your family coping with, or paying for, your health care needs right now?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: That's good to hear that you haven't needed healthcare recently. You mentioned that you're concerned about your dad's smoking habit; has your family had to manage any healthcare needs related to that or anything else? How do you ensure that your family stays healthy and manages any potential healthcare costs?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: So far, no. He's been healthy. I mean, as a family, I think we didn't have any medical scare. I mean, it's only three members, two, and both of them are medical doctors. I think it's hopefully they know what they're doing. So no.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Some people are excited about medical vaccination, and others, not so much. How about you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I think vaccination is important. I mean, I think it's a fantastic way to, you know, prevent large scale illness and for individuals as well. So yes, I find it to be an important part of our health strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: What are your trusted sources of information about the vaccine?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I usually listen to my mom, especially her medical field and research field, in the past at least I had fairly closely, it was closely related to some of these topics, so I listen to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: That's great to hear. In addition to your mom, are there any other sources or platforms, like government health websites, scientific journals, or trusted news outlets, that you rely on for information about the Covid-19 vaccine?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Stanford, my current institution, does send out, what is it, you know, notifications. So I usually listen to them. I trust, you know, the community here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Now we’re going to talk a bit more about what life was like for you over the past year. Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I've been feeling good. I mean, there's sort of a day-to-day stress in the sense that, you know, being a researcher, you don't really know. I think the most fun part of being a researcher is that you don't know what's going to happen the next day, like with your experiment and with your direction, whether you're going the right direction or not. But at the same time, that can be quite daunting in some ways. So it's a bit of a, you know, they're both sides to that. But otherwise, I've been doing well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Tell me a story about a time in the last year when you were in a rough place or struggling emotionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: So there's a current paper that we're working on that we just submitted. It was a tough one. It sort of had a lot of members on the team, and they contributed many great ideas, but correlating every opinion into sort of one narrative, right? And some of them were very vocal about things, too. And I think there's sort of a lot of uncertainty as to whether this is the right direction, whether this is rigorous enough. So there was a lot of challenge with that. And it does cause a lot of sort of emotional struggle as well as sort of a mental and intellectual struggle. But it's part of the job. It's part of research. So I take it as what it is. But again, that's what makes it fun. That's why I want to come back to work, because I want to see what happens tomorrow. And that's what keeps me going. So I think it's, you know, you get both.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Some people say they struggle with depression, anxiety, or something else like that. How about for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: No, nothing like that. I've been fairly stable in that sense. No anxiety, depression. That's sort of worth mentioning. I mean, I get stressed sometimes, but you know, like everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: It's great to hear that you haven't experienced anxiety or depression. You mentioned feeling stressed sometimes, which is quite common. Could you tell me a bit more about what usually triggers that stress for you and how you manage it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: You know, I mean, it's the relatively, I think, obvious things like, you know, research has its own uncertainties that you need to navigate, which is both fun but also can be a little bit daunting at times. Managing people in that way, in that context, I think you sort of need to have the balance between the care but also sort of the discipline to push the project through. So balancing that doesn't require care, and you sort of want to do a good job doing that. So I think there is that responsibility. So just those kind of things, but nothing too sort of special in that sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you face in your research and how you handle them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Some people say that religion or spirituality is important in their lives, for others not so much. How about you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Not so much for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: That's interesting to hear. I'm curious, what are the main sources of support or guidance you find meaningful in your life? Are there particular philosophies, practices, or communities that provide you with a sense of purpose or direction?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I originally got my training as an artist, and I think I always had a little bit of that flavor to the work that I do, where the things I do, the way I live, the way I create, even research papers, is a form of expression, and that inherently has to do with taste. What kind of things are you drawn by? What do you find beautiful? So you pursue that to the best of your ability, and looking back, you hope that the path you took will have had a meaning, but it's a little bit hard to tell what kind of meaning those paths will have. Looking forward, it's much more clear when you look backward. So I think what I usually try to do is believe that things will sort of point to a future that to me is fulfilling, and have the courage to say, you know, I just keep walking, even though things might be a little bit rough, things might be tiring now, and so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Some people tell us they use Facebook, Instagram, or other social media to stay connected with the wider world. How about for you? Tell me all about how you use these types of platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: My academic community seems to really like Twitter, so I use Twitter just to keep in touch with my professional colleagues and the work that they're doing. So when they write new papers, they tend to share on Twitter. There's sort of a huge also AI community on Twitter for whatever reason that has become sort of the main platform. So I do check Twitter. I'm not a social media person, even though I have in the past studied social media as a part of my research. I don't really like using social media too much, so I don't really use Facebook. I mean, I do post on Instagram every once in a while. I sort of have an artist account. So yeah, but that's the extent of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Some people say they use Facebook or Twitter to get (emotional or financial) support during tough times. What about you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: No, nothing like that, especially, yeah, I don't tend to be very expressive in that way. When things are tough, I tend to deal with things more internally and get support from sort of my closest friends and family members, but I don't really express it publicly. I try not to, at least, and I've been fairly good at doing, you know, being fairly restricting in that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Tell me about any recent changes in your level of stress, worry, and your emotional coping strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: No, there hasn't been much change. For me, it's been fairly consistent over the years. Good night's sleep, I think, does matter. But it's usually much more introspective. I try to find out what is the root cause of what's giving me the stress. Usually, for me, for instance, when something is not working in my research and that's stressful, I think it's often easy to get disheartened by that. But I think what I've found over the years is, keep walking forward despite the uncertainty or the stress is oftentimes the best way to go about things. That's what gets you the result. That's what keeps you moving and less worried. So that's what I usually do. I go back to the fundamentals. That's my coping strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: This might be repetitive, but before we go on to the next section, I want to quickly make sure I have this right: who are you living with right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Uh, no one. Just alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Anyone who usually lives here but is away – traveling, at school, or in a hospital?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Nope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Thanks for confirming that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Who shares the responsibility for the rent, mortgage, or other household expenses?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: No one. I mean, my parents sometimes help me out if need be, but I can mostly cover those.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Now we’d like to talk about how you make ends meet and what the monthly budget looks like for you and your family. What were your biggest expenses last month?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: Likely the rent. Yeah, the rent here is not cheap. It's Palo Alto. You know, I have an apartment, so it's downtown Palo Alto, so it's not a cheap place to live. I mean, also, I don't really spend money other than that, so it has to be actually that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Does your household own or rent your home?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I live, I rent an apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Renting in Palo Alto must come with its set of challenges and benefits. Can you share more about your experience renting there and whether you've considered owning a home in the future?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I mean, things are fairly overpriced for what they offer. I mean, maybe not overpriced. I mean, maybe it is the right price given the location. So that's, I mean, the pricing is definitely the main challenge. But no, I haven't... I think there was a brief time when we considered owning a place somewhere around Palo Alto. But no, we haven't gone through with that. So no, not really. But maybe I should buy a place soon. Or not soon, but at some point. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Bills can fluctuate over the course of a year. Seasons change, there are holidays and special events, school starts and ends, and so on. Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: It really doesn't, right. I mean, yeah, no, it's mostly just food expenses and rent. I mean, I do need to buy plane tickets because I do go back to Korea. My parents are now back in Korea, so I go see them every winter, so there's that. So I need to buy like plane tickets, so that spikes some pricing, but otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Tell me all about how you coped with any extra expenses in the past months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: We didn't have that much extra expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: I understand that you mentioned there haven't been many extra expenses recently. In general, how do you manage your finances when unexpected costs do arise, like the plane tickets to Korea or any other unplanned expenses?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I'm not young enough to be dependent on my parents, but because I am technically a student and grad student, salary can be fairly limiting, I do still get some financial help from my parents, or I have in the past. In the recent years, I have some savings saved up from various other things that have come along the way that I don't really have to worry too much about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Some people save for big things, like a home, while others save for a rainy day. How about for you (in the last year)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: To be honest, I don't really think too much about this. Maybe for a rainy day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. When you mention saving for a rainy day, do you have any particular scenarios in mind? For example, are there unexpected expenses, like health emergencies, or opportunities, like travel, that you might be saving for?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I mean, I can see emergencies arise, although by definition, I don't exactly know what they're gonna be. But in general, I don't really have any like unforeseen expenses in my life. My life has been very consistent over the past quite some number of years. My general life philosophy is because things in my like day-to-day work and research can be so unstable, I try to make everything else to be extremely stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Your approach to keeping a stable life outside of your research makes a lot of sense. Thank you for sharing this with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Some people have student loans or credit card debt. Others take out loans from family or friends or find other ways of borrowing money. Tell me about all the debts you’re paying on right now.\n",

      "Joon: There wasn't a time like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're managing your finances quite well. Could you share some of the strategies or habits you use to ensure you never run into a situation where you can't cover your expenses?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: My expenses don't really change, so it's very predictable. I know my range and I try to keep it there.\n",
      "\n",

      "Interviewer: What is or was your occupation? In this occupation, what kind of work do you do and what are the most important activities or duties?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I'm a researcher in computer science, focusing on AI, human-computer interaction. In particular, I study AI agents, generative agents, simulations. Really this job has to do with pushing the boundary of our knowledge, you know, finding new paradigms for research, development, and so forth. So that's what I do.\n",

      "Interviewer: In the past year, how many weeks did you work (for a few hours, including paid vacation, paid sick leave, and military service)?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Switching gears a bit, let’s talk a little about tax time. Did you file taxes last year (the most recent year)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s good to hear. Were there any particular challenges or difficulties you encountered while filing your taxes? And did you handle it yourself, or did you seek assistance from a professional?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: We have an accountant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Tell me more about your workplace. How long have you been at your current job? How would you describe the benefits that come with your job? (This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: So I've been a PhD student here for now, this is my fifth year. And I mean, I think we get like in a health care and those kind of things. But really, the main benefit is the ability to sort of work with, you know, really smart colleagues and, you know, learn from them and so forth. And I find that to be the main benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Joon: Yeah, no, I mean, we don't really have bosses per se. We have advisors, but no, they're my closest mentor. So it's been great. I don't think I would have had the career I did without them. So kudos to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Tell me about how predictable your work schedule is. How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joon: It's really unpredictable, right? Because again, with research, you really don't know at what stage, like, what's going to happen. So sometimes, sometimes maybe you thought you'd be done with this experiment, but you find out that something is not quite working or you need to do a little bit more conceptual thinking, then you go back to the drawing board and, you know, redo a lot of the work that you've done. Whereas sometimes things move much quicker, right? And then there are times when, you know, you know, obviously there are deadlines, so when deadline approaches, then you can sort of expect yourself to be writing a lot, so that's sort of its own sort of, you know, thing. So it's really hard to predict. You don't know what's going to happen. And that's what makes it fun.\n",

      "\n",
      "Joon: I have enough saved up that I don't think 400 is sort of a spending that I would be particularly distressed about. So yeah, it should be okay.\n",

      "\n",
      "Interviewer: Overall, how do you feel about your financial situation?\n",

      "Joon: I was not born in the U.S., I was born in Korea. What year did I come first? So I came when I was like 11 or so. So that must have been 19 years ago, almost 20 years ago. So, yeah, it must have been like 2007, 2008, 2007 maybe, or something like that, 2006, in that range.\n",

What I hope is in the years to come, this field grows into a field that actually has a certain impact, that is positive and impactful to people's lives. Especially the work that we're sort of leading has to do with this idea of simulations, right? Simulating human lives and societies so that we can better test out policies and social scientific theories. And my hunch is that if you can do that really well, there's going to be a huge opportunity to empower our society in the way we sort of navigate the wicked challenges and so forth. That really excites me. Doing a sort of a, you know, doing our work so that we can lay the foundation in that line of work and being a, you know, meaningful and fruitful steward of the field, that matters a lot to me. I do care a lot about sort of the artistic passion in the sense that, I mean, this is all a creative process. So I do think many of the things, when I look back, a lot of, I look back to the work that I've done as sort of, you know, and to get the sense of whether, you know, the path I took was a fruitful one. And I think it's so long as it's true to me and the way I sort of decided to live. I think that's what matters. So that's what I hope. I do one day, you know, like to, you know, live somewhere quieter, maybe in the mountains or, you know, somewhere like that. And, you know, maybe have a small, you know, cafe or something. I joke about that, but I think there's some elements of truth in that. I really do sort of admire slightly more idyllic lifestyle too. So maybe someday, maybe I can paint and stuff like that, if ever comes to that. Thank you.\n",

And, of course, I care about people around me. You know, I don't have a lot of close friends or acquaintances, but the ones who are close to me are very close to me, and I care a lot about them and making sure that I can support them in the future and continue to do so.
